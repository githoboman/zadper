## Register

brand

(The public page is landing-led and strictly explanatory. The live AgentPay workspace is a separate app view opened only after explicit launch intent.)

## Users

Hackathon judges and Bot Chain ecosystem developers evaluating AgentPay, plus operators of autonomous agents who open the app workspace to run a real quote → x402 → proof → registry flow. They arrive cold, usually via the demo video or repo link, and decide within one viewport whether this is a real settlement rail or a mockup.

## Product Purpose

AgentPay is an x402-paid evidence desk: agents buy live Bot Chain product evidence, verify the Merkle proof against the dataset root, and record the trust decision on the Bot Chain AgentPayRegistry contract. The UI must make the commit-root → pay → prove → clear sequence legible at a glance and let a connected agent run it end-to-end.

## Brand Personality

Exact, settled, live. The feel of a precision trading desk: calm surfaces, one saturated brand orange carrying the energy, monospace reserved for what is actually data (hashes, amounts, network ids). Confidence through evidence, not through claims.

## Anti-references

- Crypto-landing maximalism: neon gradients on black, 3D coins, glow-everything.
- Generic SaaS template: cream background, icon-card grids, eyebrow labels above every section.
- The previous iteration's failure mode: every string in heavy mono, grid-paper texture on every surface, six ambient animations competing at once.

## Design Principles

1. Show the rail, don't describe it. The hero visual is the product flow itself, animated.
2. Mono means data. If a string is not a hash, amount, state, or network id, it is not monospace.
3. Motion is settlement. Animations travel along the quote → x402 → proof → registry path or signal state changes; nothing drifts decoratively without meaning.
4. The landing explains before it operates. Agent controls do not appear on the public page; they live in the launched app workspace.
5. Evidence stays verbatim. Hashes, readiness checks, and copy that tests or agents depend on are never paraphrased for aesthetics.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- WCAG AA contrast (≥4.5:1 body, ≥3:1 large text) in both themes; light is the default theme.
- Full `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback: ambient and entrance motion collapse to static or instant.
- All interactive elements keyboard-reachable with visible focus; decorative scenes are `aria-hidden`.
